Hi, Iam @chunwendu-0, a mother of two in her late 30's. recently took a deep thought on how retirement is going took like,
with few experience i have had in other duties as a braidder, enterprenuer, customer relation,
i realized that i always felt incomplete and attracted to the tech world, so i made a decision to stop procastinating
luckily the pandemic had made many things done remotrly nad virtually,
So i picked up the advanced data analytics course on coursera
upon the first introduction to the course i was amazed to find out that our day to day life has been unconsciouly analyzed by us,
As it got deeper i fell inlove, especially with the introduction of SQL,TABLEAU, and R. to clean,process,validate, visualize, record and present our data. its been atremendous process/experience
i am looking forward to the wonderful people i will meet down this path.
